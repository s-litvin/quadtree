# Quadtree
Particle collision detection using quadtree. A quadtree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children.

Quadtrees are the two-dimensional analog of octrees and are most often used to partition a two-dimensional space by recursively subdividing it into four quadrants or regions.
